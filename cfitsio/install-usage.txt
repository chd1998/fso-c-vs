1. windows下编译cfitsio

解压源代码至x:\cfitsio
cd x:\cfitsio
mkdir cfitsio.build
cd cfitsio.build
cmake.exe -G  "Visual Studio 16 2019"  ..\
cmake.exe --build . --config Release

2. 使用
Using CFITSIO when compiling and linking application programs 

First, depending on your particular programming environment, it may be
necessary to copy the cfitsio.lib and cfitsio.dll files into another
directory where your compiler expects to find them.  Or equivalently, you
may need to specify the directory path to the location of the CFITSIO
library files when creating a project that uses them.  You may also need to
copy the fitsio.h and longnam.h include files from the \cfitsio source file
directory to a standard 'include' directory on your system.

When using the Visual Studio command line window, application programs can
be compiled and linked with CFITSIO using the following command:

		cl /MD your_program.c cfitsio.lib

The /MD command line switch must be specified to force the compiler/linker
to use the appropriate runtime library.   If this switch is omitted, then
the fits_report_error function in CFITSIO will likely crash.  

When building programs in the Visual Studio graphical environment, one can
force the equivalent of the /MD switch by selecting 'Settings...' under the
'Project' menu, then click on the C/C++ tab and select the 'Code Generator'
category.  Then under 'User Run-time Library' select 'Multithreaded DLL'.
